            <p class="paragraph">
                1) In order to use the Website, you may be required to provide information about yourself including your name, email address and other personal information ("Personal Information").

The treatment of your Personal Information and other related information, shall be in accordance with the V4U Privacy Policy.
                <br><br><br>
                2) You are solely responsible for your conduct and any data that you submit, post or display on or via the Website. We shall have no liability for conduct in relation to your use of our Website. You are solely responsible for any legal consequences arising out of your inappropriate use of the website.
                <br><br><br>
                3) You authorize V4U to contact you via email id, mobile (information provided by you in your interaction with the website) to share with you promotional, informational or any other content that it deems fit.

                <br><br><br>
                5) While you can choose to start the plan anytime after purchase without any time limit, once you activate the plan (consume the first session), you need to consume the plan within 6 months.

                <br><br><br>
                6)You can cancel or reschedule a session booked on V4U up to 24 hours before the scheduled time by requesting the same via the V4U website. Post that rescheduling will not be permitted and the session will be deemed to be consumed by you even if you do not attend. 
                <br><br><br>
                7) V4U may terminate these Terms for any reason at any time. We reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to and use of the Website, with or without prior notice. Otherwise applicable sections of the Terms shall survive termination. In addition to any termination rights, we reserve the right to enforce and prosecute any violations of these Terms.

                8) You understand that by using the Website you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information and aggregate data as set forth in our Privacy Policy.
                <br><br><br>
                9) You understand that V4U cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.

                10) By use of the website and the services, the user acknowledges that he/she is solely responsible for any and all actions, liabilities, consequences, decisions, behaviours (“conduct”) arising out of or in connection with the use of the website and/or services, and shall in no way hold V4U and/or its affiliates responsible for such conduct.
